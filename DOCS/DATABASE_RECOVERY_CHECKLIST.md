# Database Recovery System Checklist

This checklist ensures that the payment gateway's database recovery system meets industry best practices for data reliability and security.

## Monitoring & Detection

- [x] **Continuous Monitoring**: System actively monitors database health with regular integrity checks
- [x] **Real-time Corruption Detection**: Detects JSON corruption, malformation, and schema issues
- [x] **File System Validation**: Verifies required files exist and have proper permissions
- [x] **Performance Impact**: Monitoring has minimal impact on system performance
- [x] **Caching Mechanism**: Status is cached to reduce redundant file operations

## Backup System

- [x] **Automated Backups**: Regular backups occur on a configurable schedule
- [x] **Manual Backup Option**: Admins can trigger backups on-demand via UI
- [x] **Corruption-triggered Backups**: System automatically backs up files when corruption detected
- [x] **Backup Rotation**: Old backups are pruned to prevent disk space issues
- [x] **Backup Integrity Validation**: All backups are validated for integrity
- [x] **Backup Storage Security**: Backups are stored with appropriate permissions
- [ ] **Remote Backup Storage**: Backups can be stored to remote services (configurable)
- [ ] **Encrypted Backups**: Sensitive data in backups is encrypted

## Recovery Process

- [x] **Automatic Repair**: System attempts to repair minor corruption automatically
- [x] **Manual Recovery Option**: Admin interface for manual recovery operations
- [x] **Recovery Verification**: System validates database integrity after recovery
- [x] **Backup Selection**: Admin can choose which backup to restore from
- [x] **Recovery Logging**: All recovery actions are logged for audit purposes
- [x] **Non-destructive Recovery**: Original corrupted files are backed up before recovery
- [x] **Custom Backup Upload**: Admins can upload external backup files
- [ ] **Partial Recovery**: Can restore individual database components rather than all files

## Notification System

- [x] **Admin Dashboard Alerts**: Persistent visual alerts for database issues
- [x] **Detailed Error Information**: Specific information about corruption issues
- [x] **Status Reporting**: Current database status displayed clearly
- [ ] **Email/SMS Alerts**: Configurable external notifications for critical issues
- [ ] **Webhook Integration**: Can notify external systems of database corruption

## Security Considerations

- [x] **API Authentication**: All database management routes require authentication
- [x] **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks
- [x] **Path Traversal Prevention**: File paths are validated to prevent directory traversal
- [x] **Upload Validation**: Uploaded backups are validated before processing
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all database operations and recoveries

## Testing & Validation

- [x] **Automated Tests**: Dedicated test script to verify recovery functionality
- [x] **Controlled Corruption Tests**: Tests deliberately create and detect corruption
- [x] **Recovery Tests**: Validate recovery from backups works correctly
- [ ] **Load Testing**: System tested under high load conditions
- [ ] **Failure Scenario Testing**: Various edge cases and failure modes tested

## Documentation

- [x] **Architecture Documentation**: Complete explanation of recovery system design
- [x] **Admin Documentation**: Clear instructions for administrators
- [x] **API Documentation**: All recovery endpoints documented
- [x] **Best Practices**: Documented best practices for database management
- [x] **Troubleshooting Guide**: Steps to resolve common issues

## Performance & Scalability

- [x] **Minimal Performance Impact**: Recovery system has minimal impact on normal operations
- [x] **Scalable Design**: System can handle growing database sizes
- [x] **Resource Efficiency**: Backups and validations are optimized for resource usage
- [ ] **Concurrent Operations**: System handles multiple simultaneous recovery operations

## Compliance & Best Practices

- [x] **Data Protection**: Follows data protection principles
- [x] **Non-blocking Operations**: Recovery operations don't block normal system function
- [x] **Graceful Degradation**: System remains functional even with database issues
- [x] **Separation of Concerns**: Modular design with clean separation of responsibilities
- [ ] **GDPR Compliance**: Handles personal data in compliance with regulations

## Development & Maintenance

- [x] **Clean Code**: Well-structured, commented, and maintainable code
- [x] **Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout
- [x] **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all operations
- [x] **Modularity**: Components are modular and loosely coupled
- [x] **Configuration Options**: System is configurable via environment variables
