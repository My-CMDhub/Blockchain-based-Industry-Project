2. They can pay directly from their cryptocurrency wallet by:
   - Scanning the QR code with their mobile wallet app
   - Copying the payment address to their wallet
3. The page will automatically update once payment is detected
4. A confirmation receipt will be shown upon successful payment

## Managing Payments

### Merchant Dashboard

The dashboard provides an overview of your payment activity:

- **Recent Transactions**: Shows the most recent payments
- **Transaction Status**: Pending, Confirmed, Failed
- **Balance Overview**: Total funds received and available for release
- **Analytics**: Payment trends and statistics

### Transaction Details

Click on any transaction to see detailed information:

- Transaction hash (viewable on block explorer)
- Amount received
- Timestamp
- Status (including confirmation count)
- Customer details (if available)
- Payment address

### Handling Wrong Payments

Sometimes customers may send incorrect amounts:

1. Navigate to "Wrong Payments" in the dashboard
2. Review the list of payments that don't match expected amounts
3. For each payment, you can:
   - Mark as resolved (if you've handled it offline)
   - Refund the payment (requires manual processing)
   - Apply to a different order (if applicable)

## Releasing Funds

When you're ready to transfer received cryptocurrency to your merchant wallet:

### Single Release

1. From the dashboard, click "Release Funds"
2. Enter the amount you wish to release
3. Review the transaction fee estimate
4. Click "Confirm Release"
5. Enter your authentication code if prompted
6. The system will execute the transaction and provide a transaction hash

### Release All Funds

To release all available funds:

1. Click "Release All Funds" from the dashboard
2. Review the total amount and transaction fee
3. Confirm the release
4. Monitor the transaction status in the "Recent Releases" section

### Automatic Releases

You can configure automatic releases based on:

- Threshold amount (e.g., release when balance exceeds 1 ETH)
- Schedule (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Configure these settings in the "Release Settings" section

## Stripe Integration

In addition to cryptocurrency, you can accept credit card payments via Stripe:

### Enabling Stripe

1. Go to "Payment Methods" in settings
2. Toggle "Enable Stripe Payments"
3. Connect your Stripe account or enter your API keys
4. Configure payment options (accepted cards, etc.)

### Customer Experience

When Stripe is enabled, customers will see two payment options:

1. Cryptocurrency (ETH)
2. Credit Card

If they choose credit card, they'll be directed to a secure Stripe payment form.

### Stripe Dashboard

All Stripe transactions will appear in:

1. Your payment gateway merchant dashboard
2. Your Stripe dashboard (manage refunds and disputes there)

## Security

### Key Security

- All sensitive keys are encrypted and stored securely
- Wallet keys are managed using a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet system
- Google Cloud Secret Manager is used for the highest level of security

### Best Practices

1. **Never share your login credentials**
2. **Enable two-factor authentication** for your merchant account
3. **Regularly rotate your API keys** if you use the API
4. **Monitor your transactions** for any suspicious activity
5. **Set up email alerts** for large transactions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Payment Not Detected

If a customer reports they've sent payment but it's not showing up:

1. Check the transaction hash on a block explorer
2. Verify they sent to the correct address
3. Ensure they sent the correct amount
4. Allow 2-3 minutes for network confirmation
5. Check the "Pending Transactions" section in your dashboard

#### Failed Release

If a fund release fails:

1. Check your network connection
2. Verify your merchant wallet address is correct
3. Ensure there are sufficient funds (including for transaction fees)
4. Try again with a smaller amount (network conditions may require lower gas)
5. Contact support if the issue persists

#### Dashboard Not Loading

If you encounter issues with the dashboard:

1. Clear your browser cache
2. Try a different browser
3. Check your internet connection
4. Ensure you're using a supported browser
5. Contact support if the issue persists
